Enjoying fiction requires one the suspend ones disbeliefs about the fictional world one tries to engage in. As a physicist, I could do so, to a certain extent, but learning whatever little neurobiology, especially sapolsky's works, it has become neigh impossible to so. And thus, most of the books you will find here would be scientific, non-fictional and political satires.

# Here are some of the books I am currently reading or have read.
