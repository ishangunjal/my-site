Enjoying fiction requires one the suspend ones disbeliefs about the fictional world one tries to engage in. As a physicist, I could do so, to a certain extent, but learning whatever little neurobiology (mostly stemming from reading Dr. Sapolsky's work), it has become neigh impossible to so. And thus, most of the books you will find here are be scientific, non-fictional or political satires.

# Here are some of the books I am currently reading or have read.
