  update: Participated in the <a href=https://events.perimeterinstitute.ca/event/13/overview>QFT for Mathematicians 2022</a> event. A week long school followed by a virtual conference, aiming to bridge the gap between the ways physicists and mathematicians _speak_ QFT (and strings). Again, a little difficult to follow, but nonetheless extremely exciting - the things one can do with QFT! The event was organized by <a href=https://perimeterinstitute.ca/>Perimeter Institute</a>

  update: Attended the <a href=https://peoplessummit2022.org/about>People's Summit for Democracy 2022</a>. Three days of art, music, speakers, debates, workshops, panel discussions, performances - all which uplift the voices of the people and imagine a new world; one that puts people and peopleâ€™s democracy first.

  update: Participated in the <a href=https://events.perimeterinstitute.ca/event/10/>Global Categorical Symmetries</a> event. A week long conference followed by a school and workshop developing the notion of global symmetries of quantum field theories. Yeah, extremely difficult to follow, and inspiring rather than depressing puts into perspective what all is still to be understood as a physicist. The event was organized by <a href=https://perimeterinstitute.ca/>Perimeter Institute</a> and supported by the <a href=https://scgcs.berkeley.edu/>Simons Collaboration on Global Categorical Symmetries</a>.
