I am a student at the Indian [Institute of Space Science and Technology](https://iist.ac.in/) in the final year of the [Dual Degree program](https://iist.ac.in/admissions/undergraduate/dualdegree) (B.Tech. + M.S. in Solid State Physics). I am currently exploring research opportunities following the completion of the coursework.

Academically, I am interested the mathematical formulation of physics, which I feel have a nice balance between mathematical rigor and applications on the physical side. To be honest, I was drawn in by the fancy looking words, how can you see [functorial quantum field theory](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/functorial%20field%20theory) and not want to learn more about it! I am still quite naive, and can't quite put my finger on a specific topic/subtopic I would like to work on, but here's to hoping that until I do, I remain curious, and curiosity doesn't kill the cat.

Other interests include music (progressive rock/metal, jazz, classical), visual media (particularly experimental and arthouse-y works). I have been told that I have very weird tastes, you can judge for yourselves by heading over to the media section. A newfound love for linguistics and neurobiology (yes, courtesy of Noam Chomsky), and political economy (let's not let neo-liberalism kill the planet, shall we). After graduating, I am hoping to participate in organizations/movements fighting climate change.

## Research
I am currently working on my master's thesis under [Prof. Naveen Surendran](https://iist.ac.in/physics/naveen.surendran) on topological order in spin systems. We are studying exactly solvable spin models which form stabilizer codes and are candidates for synthesizing robust quantum memories. We calculate the topological entanglement entropy, as an indicator for the underlying topological order, and see the behavior at finite temperature. A non-trivially topological ordered system at finite temperature can be used for topological quantum computation.
