//TODO: DSOTM - you certainly arent in tune; finish this up.

> everything under the sun is in tune, but the sun is eclipsed by the moon.

> I mean, they're not gonna kill ya So like, if you give 'em a quick short, sharp, shock They won't do it again. Dig it? I mean he get off lightly 'Cause I would've given him a thrashing I only hit him once! It was only a difference of opinion But really, I mean good manners don't cost nothing do they, eh?

> And you run, and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death
