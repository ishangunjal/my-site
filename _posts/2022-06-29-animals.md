The pigs are dictators scared of the unknown but want to decide what is best for all. The dogs are cut-throat corporate stooges who will use any means necessary to climb on top of the heap. The pigs use the dogs to keep the meek and subservient masses of sheep in line.

It serves as a reminder that amidst the never ending cycle of human social tragedy on a mass scale, as individuals we can find somebody we can share our lives with. Waters says the first verse means “Where would I be without you?” and the second verse says “In the face of all this other shit–you care, and that makes it possible to survive.”

> You know that I care
What happens to you
And I know that you care
For me too
